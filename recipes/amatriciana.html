    <h3>Plain and simple, one of the greatest Italian dishes: simple yet divine.</h3>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>580 grams of bucatini or your favorite pasta</li>
        <li>250 grams of guanciale</li>
        <li>8 San Marzano tomatoes</li>
        <li>40 grams of extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>6 grams of salt</li>
        <li>10 grams of pepper</li>
        <li>200 grams of Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Put immediately the water to boil for the pasta. 
            Blanch tomatoes for a few seconds, peel, remove seeds, chop them into pieces and keep aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cut guanciale into small stripes.
            In a pan put 4 tablespoons of good olive oil and saute guanciale, then add tomatoes and salt.
            The tomato sauce must become thick, so let it cook for 15 minutes over medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            At this point, you just have to cook pasta al dente, drain a few minutes before itâ€™s ready and finish cooking 
            in the sauce. 
            Keep a ladle of cooking water aside, if the sauce is too dry.
        </li>
    </ol>
