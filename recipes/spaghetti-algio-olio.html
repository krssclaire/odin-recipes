    <h3>The key is slowly toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden brown in the olive oil.</h3>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound uncooked spaghetti</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
        <li>1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
            Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes. 
            Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            While the pasta is cooking, combine olive oil and garlic in a cold skillet.
            Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. 
            Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. 
            Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into pasta.
            Pour in hot olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese;
            toss until combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
        </li>
    </ol>
