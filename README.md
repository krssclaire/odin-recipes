This project, part of The Odin Project Foundations course, is meant to practice basic Frontend development
knowledge, such as HTML and CSS.

The "design" folder contains additional images of the project designed via Figma, however the final result is not completely the same.
This project features the desktop first design approach even though it has a mobile design version. 
Note: the design it's not the best for 4K screens.
